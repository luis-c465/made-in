# Options

## Concurrency

> The number of concurrent requests the extension will make to fetch the country of origin for products on the page.

**Default Value: `50`**

If you are experiencing slow internet speeds or are on a metered connection you can lower this value to reduce the amount of data the extension uses (**For example `10` requests per second may work**). Though the extension will take longer to fetch the country of origin for products on the page.

## Clear Product Cache

> Clears the cache of products the extension has already fetched the country of origin for.

If you are experiencing issues like incorrect products being shown or products not being shown at all you can try clearing the cache to see if that fixes the issue.
