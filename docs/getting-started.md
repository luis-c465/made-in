The country of origin for products directly from the supported site.
This means that the displayed country of origin **may not be 100% accurate** as it is limited to the information provided by the seller of the product.

## Using the extension

Simply visit any of the [Supported Sites](/supported-sites) and the extension will automatically fetch the country of origin for the product and display its corresponding flag in the upper left hand corner of the product.

::: warning

The extension will use a lot of data if you are on a metered connection or slow down your internet speed.
To fix this you can slow down the rate at which the extension fetches data you can change the `concurrency` setting in the [Extension Options](/options#concurrency).

## The Popup

The popup is the main interface for the extension.
